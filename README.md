## active-window-border.ahk

This script adds a configurable border around the active window. The border dynamically updates its size and position whenever the active window changes. The borders are completely click-through and always stay on top of other windows.

### Features:
- **Dynamic Border**: Automatically adjusts around the active window.
- **Always on Top**: Ensures that the border remains visible above all other windows.
- **Click-Through**: Does not interfere with window interaction.
- **Ignored Processes/Windows**: Excludes specific processes and window classes from showing borders.
- **Configurable**: Easily adjust border properties like width, color, and transparency.

### Configuration:
- BorderWidth := 2              ; Thickness of the border in pixels
- Offset := -2                  ; Configurable offset for additional gap
- BorderColor := "ffa83c"       ; Border color in hexadecimal format (default: orange)
- TransparencyLevel := 255      ; Set transparency level (255 = fully opaque)
- DisableWhileDragging := true  ; Disable borders while dragging (default: true)

### Ignored Processes and Window Classes:
- **Ignored Processes**: Windows or applications that should not display the border. This includes processes like `Flow.Launcher.exe`, `ShellExperienceHost.exe`, and `Rainmeter.exe` by default.
- **Ignored Window Classes**: Specific window classes that are excluded from the border, such as system elements like the **Taskbar**, **Start Menu**, and **System Tray**.

### Functions:
1. **`UpdateBorder()`**:
Continuously checks for changes in the active window and updates the border accordingly. Excludes processes and windows from the update if they belong to the ignored lists.
2. **`ResetState()`**:
Resets the state and hides the borders when no valid window is active or an ignored window is detected.
3. **`HideBorders()`**:
Hides all border windows.
4. **`IsProcessIgnored(ProcessName)`**:
Checks if the given process name is in the list of ignored processes.
5. **`IsWindowClassIgnored(WindowClass)`**:
Checks if the given window class is in the list of ignored window classes.
6. **`GetProcessExeFromHwnd(hwnd)`**:
Retrieves the executable name of the active window's process.
7. **`CreateBorderWindow()`**:
Creates a transparent, click-through window that serves as the border.
8. **`GetWindowRect(hwnd)`**:
Retrieves the exact dimensions of a window using the Windows API.

### Usage:
1. Ensure AutoHotkey v2.0 is installed.
2. Adjust the configuration section to customize the border behavior, such as color, thickness, and transparency.
3. Add or modify the list of ignored processes or window classes if needed.
4. Run the script to apply a border to any active window that is not on the ignored list.

### Known Issues
- **Work Area Orange Square on Start**: A small orange square may appear in the corner of the work area on startup. This issue will go away once you interact with a window.
- **Elevated Windows**: Elevated windows (e.g., those running with administrative privileges) will return `"Access Denied"` when trying to retrieve the process name, causing the border to be skipped for those windows.

## close-active-window.ahk

This script provides a hotkey (`Ctrl+Q`) that prompts the user with a confirmation dialog before closing the active window. It retrieves the window's title and displays it in the confirmation dialog. If the window title can't be retrieved, it defaults to a generic message.

### Features:
- **Hotkey**: `Ctrl+Q` to trigger the window close confirmation.
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Ensures the user doesn't accidentally close the window by asking for confirmation.
- **Displays Active Window Title**: Shows the title of the window in the confirmation dialog. If the title can't be retrieved, it displays "this window" as a fallback.

### Functions:
1. **`^q::`**:
This hotkey function is triggered by `Ctrl+Q`:
- Retrieves the active window's title using `WinGetTitle`.
- Displays a confirmation dialog using `MsgBox` with Yes and No buttons.
- If the user selects **Yes**, the window is closed via `WinClose`.
2. **`GetWindowTitle(hwnd)`**:
This function retrieves the window title. If it can't access the title (e.g., due to elevated permissions or the window being untitled), it returns `"this window"` as a fallback.

### Usage:
1. Ensure AutoHotkey v2.0 is installed.
2. Press `Ctrl+Q` to trigger a confirmation prompt before closing the active window. The window title will be displayed if available.

### Known Issues:
- **Fallback for Untitled or Elevated Windows**:
If the active window doesn't have a valid title (e.g., if it's a system window or process without a clear title), the confirmation dialog will display the fallback message `"this window"`. This might cause some confusion about which window is being closed.
- **Handling Elevated Windows**:
The confirmation dialog will appear for elevated windows (e.g., those running with administrative privileges), but the script will be unable to close them due to system permission restrictions. To allow the script to close elevated windows, you must run it with administrative privileges by right-clicking the script and selecting **"Run as Administrator"**.

## monitor-padding.ahk

This script creates configurable transparent padding on all sides (top, bottom, left, and right) of two monitors. It reserves space on all sides of each monitor separately, so maximized windows don't overlap the padding. The script restores the original work areas upon exit and includes error handling.

### Features:
- **Configurable Monitor Padding**: Creates transparent padding around the edges of two monitors with customizable sizes for each side.
- **Work Area Management**: Adjusts the reserved work area so maximized windows don't overlap the padding.
- **Restoration**: Automatically restores the original work area when the script exits.
- **Multi-Monitor Support**: Configures two monitors by manually specifying their size and position.
- **Periodic Checks**: Regularly verifies and resets the work area if necessary.

### Configuration:
- **Bar Sizes**: Customize padding size for each side of each monitor:
bar1 := { top: 36, bottom: 36, left: 36, right: 36 }
bar2 := { top: 36, bottom: 36, left: 36, right: 36 }
- **Monitor Configuration**: Manually define the position and size of each monitor:
monitor2 := { left: 0, top: 0, width: 2560, height: 1440 }     ; Primary Monitor (Monitor 2)
monitor1 := { left: 2560, top: 0, width: 2560, height: 1440 }  ; Secondary Monitor (Monitor 1)

### Functions:
1. **`createBarsForMonitor(monitor, barConfig)`**:
Creates transparent padding for all sides of a monitor using the specific bar size configuration.
2. **`createBar(x, y, w, h)`**:
Creates a single transparent, click-through bar at the specified position and size.
3. **`reserveWorkAreaForMonitor(monitor, barConfig)`**:
Adjusts the work area to reserve space for the transparent padding on a specific monitor.
4. **`checkAndResetWorkArea()`**:
Periodically checks and resets the work area if it doesn't match the desired configuration.
5. **`isWorkAreaCorrect(monitor, desiredWorkArea)`**:
Checks if the current work area matches the desired work area for a monitor.
6. **`setWorkArea(workArea)`**:
Sets the work area to the specified configuration.
7. **`restoreWorkArea(originalWorkArea, monitorName)`**:
Restores the original work area for a specific monitor.
8. **`destroyBars(bars)`**:
Removes all created transparent bars.
9. **`exitFunc(ExitReason, ExitCode)`**:
Handles script exit by restoring original work areas and destroying bars.

### Usage:
1. Ensure AutoHotkey v2.0 is installed.
2. Adjust the bar size configuration and monitor configuration according to your setup.
3. Run the script to apply the configured transparent padding around all sides of your monitors.
4. The script will periodically check and reset the work area if necessary.
5. The original work areas will be restored when the script exits.

### Known Issues:
- **Manual Updates**: The script needs to be manually updated to reflect changes in monitor configurations if they differ from the pre-set values.
